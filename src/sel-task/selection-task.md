# Selection Task

Hey there, Welcome to the **A.T.O.M**'s wiki. This section contains information about **2022's selection task** for joining **A.T.O.M**, _the robotics society of MAIT_. 

Currently, As of now we are working on multiple projects and are need of skilled individuals who could help with the functioning of the society. The following positions are opened as of now.
- **CAD designer**		0/2<br>
	_You will be working on projects that require a model to be constructed in order to be used in real life or simulated environment. You will also be required to teach & share your experience with the other fellow members. Head over to [CAD Selection Tasks](./cad_sel.md) for a detailed information related to the task._

- **OpenCV specialist**		0/2<br>
	_For the OpenCV position your would be working on the perception based problems, that helps the bot to see & visualize the environment around itself. You would be required to help indepth knowledge or enough to learn and troubleshoot as the problems arises. Information related to the OpenCV selection task could be found here [Click here](./cv_sel.md)_

**Question**: _What kind of students would fit perfect for these positions_<br>

**Question**: _What are we gonna get after joining this yet another society related to tech n blah blah stuff?_
**Ans**: _Buddy, a whole lotta experience related to "tech stuff" known as robotics. Robotics is a field which includes portion of every engineering branch. From programing to mechanical, electronics to electrical everything would be covered. Each every project would involve two stages: simulation and hardware. So from going all theory to more practical based approach would surely help you understand your enrolled courses more or even you may find other branches interesting with this method.
