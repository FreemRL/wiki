* After the linux installation is done you should install the OpenCV and its required dependencies.

	(you may also install python-is-python3 as it'll help you resolve the python2 and python3 conflits later on when you will be using python3 with shebang.)

* Install neofetch on your ubuntu desktop.

* Type "neofetch" inside your terminal and screenshot it. Also screenshot the output of you importing OpenCV inside a python command line terminal.

* Add these screenshots as your task 1 submission.

>**Note:** Its okay if you are not familiar with linux we'll guide you through the whole process 
Once you are done with the task 1 please submit it by heading over to [Submissions](./submissions.md)
