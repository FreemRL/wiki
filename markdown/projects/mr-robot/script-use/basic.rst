Basic Project Overview
======================

MR-ROBOT is an autonomous robot project that is designed to navigate its environment using the ROS (Robot Operating System) navigation stack. This project is a modular robot, which means that it is built with interchangeable parts that can be customized to suit different use cases.

The MR-ROBOT project is built on top of the ROS navigation stack, which is a collection of software packages that provide navigation and mapping capabilities for robots. This allows MR-ROBOT to use sensors such as LIDAR, cameras, and inertial measurement units to accurately navigate its surroundings and avoid obstacles.

One of the key benefits of the MR-ROBOT project is its modularity. This means that it can be customized to suit a wide range of applications, from warehouse automation to agricultural robotics. This modularity is achieved through the use of interchangeable parts and components, such as sensors, manipulators, and end-effectors.

The MR-ROBOT project is an exciting development in the field of autonomous robotics, as it combines the power of the ROS navigation stack with the flexibility of a modular robot design. By leveraging these technologies, the MR-ROBOT project has the potential to revolutionize a wide range of industries and applications, from manufacturing and logistics to healthcare and agriculture.
