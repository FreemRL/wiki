Hints
-----

-  The turtle needs to move in a vertical ‘D’ shape with a radius of 1 unit
   during its sem-circular motion.
   
-  Use linear velocity as well as angular velocity with some combination
   to get this done.

-  Keep tracking the distance travelled so as to know when to stop. You
   can refer to Overview of rospy for more hint
